## Caesar Cipher ##
  Caesar Cipher is a two activity Android app that encrypts plain text messages and decrypts encrypted messages.

  One of the simplest examples of a substituion cipher is the Caesar cipher, which is said to have been used by Julius Caesar to communicate with his army. Caesar is considered to be one of the first persons to have ever employed encryption for the sake of securing messages. Caesar decided that shifting each letter in the message would be his standard algorithm, and so informed all of his generals of his decision, and was then able to send them secured messages. Using the Caesar Shift, with a rotation value of 3 (which is rotation letter 'D'; remember in computer science we start counting from 0 (zero)), the message: "RETURN TO ROME" would be encrypted as "UHWXUQ WR URPH." In this example, 'R' is shifted to 'U', 'E' is shifted to 'H' and so on. Now, even if the enemy did intercept the message, it would be useless, since only Caesar's generals could read it.

  Only alphabetic characters encrypted (respecting upper and lowercase): a, b, c, A, B, C, etc. All other symbols are ignored. For example, numbers (1, 2, 3, etc.) and punctuation symbols (~, !, @, #, $, etc.) are all ignored.
